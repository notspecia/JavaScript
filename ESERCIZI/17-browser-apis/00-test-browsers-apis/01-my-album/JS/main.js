Create a page with 10 random images that are dynamically loaded using 
requests when the user opens the page
The images should be of the same height and width. There should be 4 images 
per row, so a 4x3 grid that fits the 10 images
 The user can click buttons to load a new image in real time, or remove an image
 The user can also arrange the images in the gallery using drag and drop
 The gallery should remember the loaded images and their order so that if the 
user returns to the page, the same images are loaded and keep the same order
