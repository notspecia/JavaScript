## Description

Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have 
properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an 
array of strings).
   
‚óè On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information

Bonus: Create an array that holds several recipes and log them all



## Approach to Solution

To create an object to hold information on a favorite recipe and log the recipe information, the following steps are taken:

1. **Recipe Object Creation**:
- An object named `recipe` is created with properties for the title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).

2. **Logging Recipe Information**:
- The recipe information is logged to the console using separate `console.log()` statements:
- The title of the recipe is logged using bracket notation: `recipe["title"]`.
- The servings for the recipe are logged using bracket notation: `recipe["servings"]`.
- The ingredients of the recipe are logged using a loop to iterate through the array: `recipe["ingredients"][i]`.

3. **Bonus Part - Multiple Recipes**:
- An array named `recipes` is created to hold several recipe objects.
- Each recipe object contains properties for title, servings, and ingredients.
- Using a nested loop, the information for each recipe is logged to the console, including the title, servings, and ingredients.
- Dot notation (`recipes[i].title`, `recipes[i].servings`, `recipes[i].ingredients[j]`) is used to access the properties of each 
  recipe object.

This approach effectively creates and logs information for a favorite recipe object, as well as multiple recipe objects stored in an array.
