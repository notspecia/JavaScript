Create a simulation of a turn-based combat system in a Dungeons and Dragons game using two queues of cards

‚óè the card types are
    ‚óã characters, spells, or enemies

‚óè create two queues: one for each player's cards

‚óè fill each queue with N random cards of different types

‚óè each card should be an object with appropriate
    ‚óã properties e.g. strength, defense, healthh
    ‚óã methods e.g. attack(enemy), buff(character), damage(character), duel(character)
 
Turn-based Combat:

‚óè on each turn, draw one card from the start of each player's queue

‚óè based on the type of cards drawn, certain combinations might trigger 
special actions or effects, such as:
    ‚óã Character vs. Enemy: Attack action, dealing damage to the enemy
    ‚óã Spell vs. Character: Buff action, boosting the character's attributes or Damage action, 
      damaging or killing the character
    ‚óã Character vs. Character: Duel action, comparing attributes to determine the winner
    ‚óã Enemy vs. Enemy: No effect
    
‚óè award points to each player based on the remaining healthh of their used 
character cards
