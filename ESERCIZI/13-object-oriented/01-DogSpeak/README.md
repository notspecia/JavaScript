## Description
Add a method to the String prototype called dogSpeak() that works as follows:
 
   let s = 'We like to learn';
   s.dogSpeak();
   'Dogs are smart'.dogSpeak();

   // Console output
   // We like to learn Woof!
   // Dogs are smart Woof!

Think about the following question:
- Is it a good idea to extend prototypes of built-in Javascript objects such as String, Array, etc?
