## Description

Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, pets, books, whatever).
For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."





## Approach to Solution

To accomplish the task:

1. **Create an Array**: We initialize an array named `topChoices` to hold our top preferences, such as colors, pets, books, etc.

2. **Log Choices**: We loop through the `topChoices` array and print each choice to the console in the format "My #1 choice is 
<choice>" using `console.log()`.

This approach ensures that each preference in the array is logged to the console as specified.
